- The minimum temperature registered during December in the years of 2010 and 2017 is 56F, but the 25, 50 and 75 percentiles don't go lower than 69, it might be a good idea to look closer at 'how many days does the tem go below 60F' to see if that is not an outlier. Looking at the maximum we can see that 83F is only 2 degrees F lower than in June
- The temperatures in December are obviously lower but not by a huge margin, and they are still temperatues apt for ice cream consumption after a hard day of surfing.

# Summary

To sumarize, the analysis shows that temperatures in December are lower but not to a temperature where ice cream consumption is not common. It might be good idea to do a count on the temperatures, to see how many times in the month the temperature touched the minimum or close to it. Also, we could show with a 'where' the statistics by station, to see if the temperature is the same throughout the island or it differs depending on location.
